// The next step is for you to add some endpoints to your API.

// The first one will be a GET request to the '/votes' path.

// The idea is for you to see who has voted for which donut.

// You will need to await a query against your `db`,
// so that it returns all information about all votes,
// and then store the result in a const called "result".

// console.log your result object,
// it should have a property called rows,
// which represents all of the votes in your table.

// Have your endpoint respond with a JSON respresentation of all of these rows.

// You can check if this is working
// by inserting a few votes into your database via psql,
// and then issuing a GET request to localhost:3000/votes
// either with your browser or with Postman.
